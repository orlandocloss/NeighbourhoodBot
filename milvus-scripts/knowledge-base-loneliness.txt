There is an increasing sense of disconnection between individuals and their neighbourhoods, particularly noticeable in Western urban environments. This is evidenced by declining social interaction rates and reduced civic engagement paired with an increase in distrust and loneliness in communities.  A 2018 U.S. study reported that only 24% of urban residents knew their neighbours. This pattern extends to civic involvement, with only about a third of people voting in local UK elections (2021).  Furthermore, trust within communities has seen a notable decline; in 1972, about 45% of Americans felt they could trust others, but by 2016, this number had reduced to roughly 30%, highlighting a growing scepticism in interpersonal and community relations. 
Meanwhile, social isolation is intensifying, as evidenced by the General Social Survey,  which shows that the number of people with no one to discuss important matters has tripled between 1985 and 2004. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, three in five American adults considered themselves lonely. Loneliness, while distinct, is part of the larger narrative of community disconnection and is often a direct consequence. The correlation between these elements highlights a shift in how individuals interact with their surroundings and each other - requiring thoughtful analysis and responsive strategies. Disconnection lies at the root of many global challenges, suggesting that strengthening community bonds is essential for addressing societal issues. We recognize the value of neighbours fostering relationships that facilitate collaborative efforts to enhance community well-being.
